My solutions for Advent of Code. 
2023 is unfinished, and solutions are written in C++. 2024 solutions are written in C.

As my timezone does not allow me to participate in the leaderboards, I have taken upon a different challenge: All solutions are written to be as performant as possible, at (almost) all costs. 
For more details on each year, read the README in its folder.

All code in this repository written by me is licensed under the AGPLv3. That is to say, everything, except 2024\epoch.c and 2024\epoch.h.
